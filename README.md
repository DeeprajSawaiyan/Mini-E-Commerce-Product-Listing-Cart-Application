# MyCart - Mini E-Commerce Application 🛒

Welcome to my mini e-commerce project! This is a frontend web application built to simulate a real online shopping experience. I built this project from scratch to strengthen my understanding of React fundamentals, state management, and API integration.

**Live Demo:** [mini-e-commerce-product-listing-car.vercel.app](https://mini-e-commerce-product-listing-car.vercel.app)

## 🌟 What Does This App Do?
- **Browse Products:** Fetches and displays real products (images, prices, and titles) using the Fake Store API.
- **Search & Filter:** Users can search for specific products by typing the name or filtering by categories like "Electronics" or "Jewelery".
- **Shopping Cart:** Users can add products to their cart, increase or decrease the quantity, and remove items.
- **Live Price Calculation:** The cart automatically calculates the total number of items and the final price in Rupees (₹).
- **Persistent Memory:** If you refresh the page or close the tab, your cart items are saved automatically using the browser's `localStorage`.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **React.js (Vite):** Used to build the user interface with functional components and hooks.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Used to style the application and make it responsive for mobile and desktop screens.
- **React Context API:** Used to manage the "global state" of the shopping cart without needing complex external libraries like Redux.
- **React Router:** Used to navigate smoothly between the Home page and the Cart page without reloading the website.
- **Axios:** Used to securely fetch data from the external API.
